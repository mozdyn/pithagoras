 *
 * The VNC client refuses to run outside a secure context, and a secure context
 * needs every ancestor to be trustworthy — so an HTTPS iframe inside the portal
 * is only secure if the portal itself is. Same-origin means it inherits
 * whatever the portal has instead of needing its own.
 *
 * And it removes a second credential and a second certificate: the portal has
 * already decided who you are, so it holds the browser's password rather than
 * asking you for it again.
